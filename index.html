    <h1>This is ES6 plus learing!</h1>
    <p>
        Learning ES6 and ES7 is essential for modern JavaScript development, as they introduce powerful features that make code more readable, efficient, and maintainable. ES6 brings key improvements like let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, promises, and modules, making JavaScript more flexible and developer-friendly. ES7 further enhances this with async/await, Object.values(), and includes(), simplifying asynchronous programming and data handling. Mastering these concepts not only improves your coding efficiency but also prepares you for working with frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node.js, where modern JavaScript is heavily used.
